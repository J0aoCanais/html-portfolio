<h3>Titanic</h3>

<p>
This is my favourite movie of all time. The realism and the way the love of two people are shown is awesome. 
</p>

<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>

<p>
I love cars, and this movie has a lot of special effects with explosions high-speed car scenes. These things made this movie one of my favourite.

<h3>Cars 3</h3>

<p>
This is my favorite animated film ever. How they made a film with cars that have love, team spirit, and competitiveness is pretty good for a car movie.
